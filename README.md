# Hidden-Sector-Limits
Scripts for generating existing limits on Hidden Sector dark matter models

Hidden_Sector_Limits.py is a script to generate g-2 limits on epsilon, as well as the epsilon value
which very approximately reproduces the dark matter relic density observed in the universe. I will
hopefully improve that calculation in the next few weeks.
